# LeetCode-Matrix-
 With the help of this app we can pull the data of Leetcode user.

 This will tell us the total number of Submissions he done till today

 Here we used leetcode GraphQL Api to fetch the data 
 It was not going directly giving a CORS error
 To avoid that we used Proxy Server to get the data
